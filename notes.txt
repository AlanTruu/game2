-> Create an abstract / or super class (item) that will then go into array list that is aggregated by the player

-> test for player to have option to select array row / damage / which row to add
-> need to create space for the player/monster inhabit. ie. 2d array that they each occupy an element of
    {1, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 0},              0 signifying that the element is an empty space. 1 being monster. 2 being player
    {0, 0, 2}               
-> encounter needs to be a loop until one of the player or monster is dead. 


Monster(HP, Str, Spd)
PLayer ("")


going to want player to have the option every turn to either move or to attack, maybe by moving player has chance to regen some hp??
